    """Crops the whitespace border around a scanned page's content, using the
    union bbox of its (denoised) contours. Ported from
    test_crop_whitespace.ipynb after parameter tuning on sample scans.

    Only crops if the content bbox covers <= max_content_area_ratio of the
    page. PP-DocLayout was trained on full pages with natural margins --
    text-dense pages (content already covering most of the page) get their
    aspect ratio distorted by cropping for no benefit, which measurably hurt
    layout detection. The crop is only worth it for sparse-content pages
    (e.g. 2 small ID-card scans on an otherwise blank A4 sheet), where the
    real content would otherwise be too small relative to the frame for the
    layout model to pick up reliably.

    Returns (cropped_image, (x0, y0)) -- the offset is the crop's top-left
    corner IN THE ORIGINAL (uncropped) image's pixel space, i.e. exactly what
    every downstream block bbox coordinate needs added back to it to map onto
    the original page render. (0, 0) when no crop happened. Threaded all the
    way out to the API's per-page "crop_offset" field (see
    DocumentPipeline._process_pages_batch / build_json) specifically so a
    client can realign an overlay drawn on its OWN from-scratch render of the
    original page -- without that, bbox coords (relative to this crop) would
    be silently offset from any uncropped re-render."""
